I'm using two of these to "protect" this file and prevent it from being
invoked in other systems. (For example, a non-Apple Mach-based system
probably has the complete pthreads implementation)

   pthread_barrier_wait   - Synchronize at a barrier

One or more threads (called "participating threads") can call this
function when they want to wait for synchronisation to occur. 

The calling thread shall block until the required number of threads
(equal to the "count" parameter that was given in
pthread_barrier_create) have called pthread_barrier_wait() specifying
the barrier. When that happens, all of the blocked threads get
unblocked, i.e. their calls to pthread_barrier_wait() return.

The return value indicates if the calling thread was "last": the
thread that caused the threshold to be reached gets the return value
PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD, while all other threads get 0.
