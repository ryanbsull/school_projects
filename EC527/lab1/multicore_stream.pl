We will test up to $num_to_test simultaneous copies of a STREAM memory-copy
benchmark, each using a buffer size up to $maxmem bytes.

The bandwidth is a function of two independent variables: the number
of simultaneous tasks, and the size of the data array that each task
is repeatedly copying. For each combination of these, two measurements
of bandwidth are printed out: total bandwidth (achieved by all tasks
combined), and bandwidth per task. Units are:

  tasks: unitless integer
  memsize: amount of memory used by each task, in bytes
  bandwidth: bandwidth achieved by all tasks combined, in bytes/second
  BW/task: bandwidth per task, in bytes/second

This will take some time, and the processor load will steadily increase.
If the computer's fans are making noise, that's probably why.
